## What is Contentstack?

[Contentstack](https://www.contentstack.com/platforms/headless-cms) is an API-first headless SaaS content management system (CMS).
For content editors, this provides an interface where content can
be modeled and managed separate from the presentation layer, or frontend.
Developers can use either a REST or a GraphQL API to retrieve this content.

## Limitations of Contentstack

The Contentstack APIs (both REST and GraphQL) have some
serious limitations in what they can and cannot do.

- When querying a content entry, the content type has to be provided
- It is not possible to query all the published locales for a content entry
- Though there are "URL" fields in Contentstack, these are actually slugs, since pages cannot have parent pages
  - This makes it impossible to nest pages in Contentstack in a way that is intuitive for content editors

These limitations make it very difficult to use the API to create a performant website.
Because of these limitations, there needs to be some
middleware layer between Contentstack and the website you want to create.
This is where the Contentstack Bridge comes in.

## Contentstack Bridge

The Contentstack Bridge has been created to tackle these exact problems.
It serves as a middleware between Contentstack and an application,
to provide the best developer experience possible.
A subset of all content entries are stored in its own database,
in a way that any content entry can be retrieved without needing to specify the content type.
A developer can choose to either query it directly from the database,
or through the built-in [API server](https://dobefu.github.io/csb/api-server/index.html).
The content entry in the response will always include all alternative locales for the entry,
allowing it to easily be added to the HTML metadata in the website.

To populate the database, a [synchronization](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/apis/content-delivery-api#synchronization) needs to be done.
The first synchronization will fetch and process all content entries,
and all subsequent calls will use the synchronization token to continue from the last sync.
This synchronization action can be triggered in a [webhook](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/set-up-webhooks/about-webhooks) to keep the data up-to-date.

Parent pages are also supported in the Contentstack Bridge, by adding a "parent" field to a content entry.
This can be added manually, or through the [CLI](https://dobefu.github.io/csb/cli/index.html).
When performing a sync, the Contentstack Bridge will recursively
look up these parent pages and construct a full URL from it.
This is what makes it possible to query a content entry by its full URL,
whilst providing content editors with an intuitive way to nest pages.
As an additional bonus, it also means that changing the slug of a parent page
will update this segment of the full URL for all child entries.

## Implementation Example

In order to test the Contentstack Bridge, I have created a reference implementation.
This has a separate [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Dobefu/csb-example-nextjs).
This project provides a complete implementation of a basic website with features
like multiple languages, sitemaps, locale switching with localized URLs,
metadata, live preview and editing, and much more.
