## About Me

Hi, I'm Connor van Spronssen, a Full-stack web engineer dedicated to crafting robust and user-friendly web experiences.
I thrive on challenges that require a deep understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies,
and I'm always eager to explore the latest advancements in the field.

When I was twelve years old, I started dabbling in programming.
I had a profound interest in computers and how they worked.
My projects were pretty basic at the time, since I didn't really understand programming back then.
Most of the projects I made back then were Windows Forms applications in Visual Studio.

At about thirteen years old, I discovered Game Maker Studio.
This is where I really got into programming.
I would often create small games to show off at school.
This would motivate me to become a game developer, which is why I eventually applied for the Grafisch Lyceum Utrecht.

At the Grafisch Lyceum Utrecht, I started learning C# and Unity3D.
I really enjoyed this, but I also found myself drawn towards web development.
In my free time, I would teach myself web development in the PHP programming language.
This eventually led me to conclude that I prefer to be a web developer, instead of a game developer.
As internships rolled around, I looked for internships in web development.
This is where I started at Wunderkraut, where I remained even after graduating.

My development workflow is heavily influenced by my commitment to efficiency and customization.
That's why I rely on [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), a highly configurable CLI text editor that allows me to tailor my environment to my specific needs.
Feel free to explore my personal Neovim configuration on [GitHub](https://github.com/Dobefu/nvim-config).

I also create various personal projects in my spare time to keep learning and improving my skills.
These projects range from web applications to CLI applications, all aimed at enhancing my expertise and practical experience in the field.
